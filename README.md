## Introduction

Apt-Cacher NG is a caching proxy, specialized for package files from Linux distributors, primarily for [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) (and [Debian based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions#Debian-based)) distributions such as [Ubuntu family](https://ubuntu.com/) but not limited to those.

It was difficult to find an ARM64 container for this workload which is why I am building this myself.

## Getting Started

Docker containers are available on [Github Container Registry](https://github.com/irish1986?tab=packages) and is the recommended method of installation.

## Hierarchy

I had been a contributor and maintaineer of [sameersbn/apt-cacher-ng](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-apt-cacher-ng) for a while but the project seems not to received the right level of commitment for it owner.  Being a secondary maintainer means I had limited access to a few topics that irritated me.  Thanks for your help and support on this project, I am forking (and restarting) this project on my own.

It is also a nice exercice rebuilding something from scratch.
